The R package `popmetrics` facilitates the calculation of age- and sex-specific 
cut-points for physical activity intensity classification based on the free-living 
accelerometer data recordings of your study sample. This methodology has been tested 
for first time using the NHANES data, specifically the first wave of accelerometer data, 
including the 2003-2004, and 2005-2006 cohorts [1].

Further details on the development of the cut-points and the specific calculations 
are provided in the dedicated vignette in this package.
